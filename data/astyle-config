# Options for formatting code with astyle.
#
# This helps to make code match the style guide.
# 
# Use like this:
# 
#     astyle --options=astyle-config mfile.h myfile.cpp
# 
# Occasionally, astyle does something silly (particularly with lambdas), so it's
# still necessary to scan the changes for things that are wrong.
# But, for most files, it does a good job.
# 
# Please consider using this before checking code in for review. Code reviews shouldn't
# have to deal with layout issues, they are just a distraction. It's better to be able
# to focus on semantics in a code review, with style issues out of the way.

# Commented out for now. It changes
#
#     for (int i=0; i<10; ++i)
# to
#     for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
#
# Unfortunately, it also messes with rvalue references:
#
#     ResourcePtr& operator=(ResourcePtr&& r);
#
# becomes:
#
#     ResourcePtr& operator=(ResourcePtr && r);
